# Reservation
Web application to make hotel reservations

This project utilizes basic web form techniques including labels, text boxes, drop-down lists, radio buttons, and validation.

The C# code-behind-the-file manages the event handlers for clicking buttons and sets the current date.

It also uses CSS classes from bootstrap to format the page.
